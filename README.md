<h1>Supervised Learning Analysis: Banking and Relational Data</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project utilizes Python to apply supervised learning techniques to two distinct real-world data domains: banking credit assessments and relational datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed). My objective is to navigate through the inherent challenges of these datasets, deploying a variety of classification methods to gain insights and predictive accuracy.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I employed several classical and contemporary supervised learning algorithms, including but not limited to Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees. Special emphasis was placed on preprocessing techniques suitable for each dataset's nature, ensuring robust model training and evaluation.</p>

<h3>Key Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Exploration:</strong> Initial analysis to understand the datasets' characteristics, distribution, and potential challenges.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Crafting and selecting meaningful features to enhance model performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Selection and Training:</strong> Comparative analysis of various algorithms to identify the most effective models for these specific datasets.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Evaluation:</strong> Utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to assess model efficacy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>My analysis revealed insightful patterns and predictive accuracies that underscore the complexities and potential of supervised learning in real-world applications.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
