# SupervisedLearning-BankingAndRelationalAnalysis
This repository explores the application of supervised learning techniques to two key domains: banking credit data and relational datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed). It aims to tackle real-world challenges through a comparative analysis of methods such as Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, and more, all implemented in Python.
