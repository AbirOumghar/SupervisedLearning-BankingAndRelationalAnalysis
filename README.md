# Supervised Learning Techniques on Real-World Data Sets

This repository showcases the practical application of a range of supervised learning techniques, including Naive Bayes, KNN, LDA, QDA, Linear and Non-Linear SVM, Logistic Regression, CART, Random Forest, and more. The project focuses on analyzing two distinct types of real-world data: bank credit data and relational data sets such as Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed, using statistical data processing tools in R and Python.

## Objective

The primary goal is to apply concrete supervised learning techniques to real data sets, exploring the complexities and challenges posed by each. The project aims to predict loan repayment outcomes in the bank credit data set and to perform comparative classification methods on relational data, highlighting the unique challenges of data alignment and classification performance.

## Data Sets

- **Bank Credit Data**: Includes financial and banking details of clients to predict loan repayment behavior. The data set comprises 1000 examples with 20 variables.
- **Relational Data (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed)**: Focuses on the classification challenges posed by relational data, including the alignment of matrix values with network structures for optimal classification results.

## Methodology

- Preliminary exploratory data analysis.
- Application of various supervised classification techniques.
- Comparative analysis using metrics like Accuracy, NMI, and F-measure, evaluated through cross-validation or test samples.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Programming Languages**: R and Python.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, caret (for R), imbalanced-learn.
- **Data Sources**: 
  - Bank Credit Data: [German Credit Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/german.csv)
  - Relational Data: Publicly available data sets of Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed.
